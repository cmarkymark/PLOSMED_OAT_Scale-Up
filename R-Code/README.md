## R Code

The code includes the following:

-ODE functions for running the model 
  -the second function allows for incorporating OAT scale-up
-Calibration functions
-Parameter Sampling Functions
-Code to calibrate sampled parameters
-Code to run the model given the calibrated parameters

The results of the study are included in the Data folder.  We have supplied the calibrated parameters for replication.  The calibrated parameters can be uploaded into R and the final portion of the code can be run to compute the model outputs.  Running the code in full will sample a new set of parameters, so results will not perfectly replicate the study.
