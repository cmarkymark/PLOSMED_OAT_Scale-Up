Here we have included the calibrated parameter sets used to run the model.  The results of the study were derived from the parameters of 10,000 iterations.  To replicate the study findings, this can be loaded into R and the R code supplied can be used to run the model and derive the output.

The remaining files are the calibrated parameters for each of the sensitivity analyses.
